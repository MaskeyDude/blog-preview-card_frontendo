### What I learned?

I already knew this but it was forgotton as I didn't use it as much. After downloading the font you'll have a .ttf file so just:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: "FontName";
    src: url(./fonts/font-name_wght.ttf);
}```

Then you can use the font yay!

```css
p {
  font-family: "FontName", sans-serif;
}
```

+ that I really like using live server when coding but it overheats my laptop TnT

## Thoughts

Well I guess I'll need to make a read.md file tempelate for myself as it's getting um... yeah I don't wanna leave it empty just cuz I got too lazy to fill it all
